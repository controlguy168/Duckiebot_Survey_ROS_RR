# Duckiebot ROS and RR Survey
## Introduction
In this survey, we want students to learn and compare robotics middleware: widely used [Robot Operating System](http://wiki.ros.org/) (ROS) and Robot Raconteur (RR) designed by RPI alumni. Given a duckiebot with Ubuntu Mate (18.04) image, the goal is to use ROS and Robot Raconteur to achieve lane following.
